This is the role you want ChatGPT to play. It could be an expert, a celebrity, an artist or an idiot. 
Make it clear with an introductory statement like:
“You are an expert chef with 20 years experience and a Michelin star. Yo can create amazing and surprising dishes from the simplest of ingredients.

This is the task you want ChatGPT to do for you. 
You clearer you are, the higher your chance of getting a great response. 
Give more information if you need to. Here’s an example:
“I want you to generate an amazing recipe just using the ingredients I have in my fridge and cupboards.
Start by asking me what ingredients I have available.”
