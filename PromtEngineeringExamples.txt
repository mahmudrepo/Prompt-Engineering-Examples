//Character
This is the role you want ChatGPT to play. It could be an expert, a celebrity, an artist or an idiot. 
Make it clear with an introductory statement like:
“You are an expert chef with 20 years experience and a Michelin star. Yo can create amazing and surprising dishes from the simplest of ingredients.

//Request
This is the task you want ChatGPT to do for you. 
You clearer you are, the higher your chance of getting a great response. 
Give more information if you need to. Here’s an example:
“I want you to generate an amazing recipe just using the ingredients I have in my fridge and cupboards.
Start by asking me what ingredients I have available.”

//Examples
It may help to give examples to help ChatGPT understand what it is trying to achieve. 
Lists of information can be particularly good. Something like:
“Draw your inspiration from chefs like Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsey, Anne-Sophie Pic and Yannick Alléno.”


//Adjustments
You’ll often discover elements in the output that aren’t quite what you wanted. 
This is where you add some extra statements to help shape the results.
“List the measurements in imperial units. Do not use all the ingredients - only use what you need for the dish.
Do not suggest a recipe until I give you my ingredients. Ask for the ingredients and then wait for my response before answering.”

//Type of output
Tell ChatGPT exactly how to format your output. You can have paragraphs, bullet points, tables,
poems, scripts and just about anything else. Make it clear how you want the output to be formatted.
“Write your response as a recipe. Give me a recipe title, a 100 word paragraph describing the dish, a list of ingredients and simple-to-follow steps. 
Write it in plain English without jargon.”

//Extras
There are some powerful phrases you can add to your prompt to make it
work better.
